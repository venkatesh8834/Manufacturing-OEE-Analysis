# Manufacturing Production Performance & OEE Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **manufacturing production performance** using key metrics such as **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**.  
Raw production data was first **cleaned and prepared using Python**, then analyzed using **SQL and Power BI** to identify inefficiencies in availability, performance, and quality.

The project simulates a real-world manufacturing environment and demonstrates how data analytics supports operational decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Measure and monitor **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**
- Identify **production losses** across machines and shifts
- Analyze **downtime, defects, and performance gaps**
- Provide data-driven insights for productivity improvement

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **SQL** – Data querying and aggregation  
- **Power BI** – Dashboarding & visualization  
- **DAX** – KPI and measure creation  
- **CSV / Excel** – Source data

## 🔄 Data Preparation (Python)
Python was used to:
- Handle missing and inconsistent values
- Convert date and time formats
- Remove duplicates
- Create derived columns required for OEE calculations
- Prepare clean datasets for SQL and Power BI analysis

## 📊 Key KPIs Used
- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)
- Availability %
- Performance %
- Quality %
- Planned vs Actual Production
- Downtime Duration
- Defect Rate
