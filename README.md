# Manufacturing Production Performance & OEE Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **manufacturing production performance** using key metrics such as **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**.  
Raw production data was first **cleaned and prepared using Python**, then analyzed using **SQL and Power BI** to identify inefficiencies in availability, performance, and quality.

The project simulates a real-world manufacturing environment and demonstrates how data analytics supports operational decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Measure and monitor **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**
- Identify **production losses** across machines and shifts
- Analyze **downtime, defects, and performance gaps**
- Provide data-driven insights for productivity improvement

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **SQL** – Data querying and aggregation  
- **Power BI** – Dashboarding & visualization  
- **DAX** – KPI and measure creation  
- **CSV / Excel** – Source data  

---

## 🔄 Data Preparation (Python)
Python was used to:
- Handle missing and inconsistent values
- Convert date and time formats
- Remove duplicates
- Create derived columns required for OEE calculations
- Prepare clean datasets for SQL and Power BI analysis

---

## 📊 Key KPIs Used
- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)
- Availability %
- Performance %
- Quality %
- Planned vs Actual Production
- Downtime Duration
- Defect Rate

## 📈 Dashboards Included

### Dashboard 1 – Production Overview
- Overall OEE score
- Availability, Performance, Quality breakdown
- Machine-wise and shift-wise comparison

### Dashboard 2 – Downtime & Loss Analysis
- Planned vs unplanned downtime
- Major loss reasons
- Downtime impact on OEE

### Dashboard 3 – Quality & Efficiency Insights
- Defect trends
- Rejection percentage
- Machine performance comparison

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Overall OEE is relatively low, indicating improvement potential
- Availability losses contribute most to OEE reduction
- Certain machines and shifts consistently underperform
- Downtime reduction can significantly improve productivity
